# Acme Controller Workshop

In this workshop we will add some functionality to a third participant in the Alice/Faber drama - namely, Acme Inc.  After completing her education at Faber College, Alice is going to apply for a job at Acme Inc.  To do this she must provide proof of education (once she has completed the interview and other non-Indy tasks), and then Acme will issue her an employment credential.

Note that an updated Acme controller is available here: https://github.com/ianco/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/acme_workshop/demo if you just want to skip ahead ...  There is also an alternate solution with some additional functionality available here:  https://github.com/ianco/aries-cloudagent-python/tree/agent_workshop/demo


## Preview of the Acme Controller

There is already a skeleton of the Acme controller in place, you can run it as follows.  (Note that beyond establishing a connection it doesn't actually do anything yet.)

To run the Acme controller template, first run Alice and Faber so that Alice can prove her education experience:

Open 2 bash shells, and in each run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python.git
cd aries-cloudagent-python/demo
```

In one shell run Faber:

```bash
./run_demo faber
```

... and in the second shell run Alice:

```bash
./run_demo alice
```

When Faber has produced an invitation, copy it over to Alice.

Then, in the Faber shell, select option ```1``` to issue a credential to Alice.  (You can select option ```2``` if you like, to confirm via proof.)

Then, in the Faber shell, enter ```X``` to exit the controller, and then run the Acme controller:

```bash
X
./run_demo acme
```

In the Alice shell, select option ```4``` (to enter a new invitation) and then copy over Acme's invitation once it's available.

Then, in the Acme shell, you can select option ```2``` and then option ```1```, which don't do anything ... yet!!!


## Asking Alice for a Proof of Education

In the Acme code ```acme.py``` we are going to add code to issue a proof request to Alice, and then validate the received proof.

First locate the code that is triggered by option ```2```:

```
            elif option == "2":
                log_status("#20 Request proof of degree from alice")
                # TODO presentation requests
```

Add the following code under the ```# TODO``` commment:

```
                # TODO presentation requests
                # ask for any degree, don't restrict to Faber (we can check the issuer when we receive the proof)
                proof_attrs = [
                    {"name": "name", "restrictions": [{"schema_name": "degree schema"}]},
                    {"name": "date", "restrictions": [{"schema_name": "degree schema"}]}, 
                    {"name": "degree", "restrictions": [{"schema_name": "degree schema"}]}, 
                ]
                proof_predicates = []
                proof_request = {
                    "name": "Proof of Education",
                    "version": "1.0",
                    "connection_id": agent.connection_id,
                    "requested_attributes": proof_attrs,
                    "requested_predicates": proof_predicates,
                }
                # this sends the request to our agent, which forwards it to Alice (based on the connection_id)
                await agent.admin_POST(
                    "/presentation_exchange/send_request", proof_request
                )
```

Now we need to handle receipt of the proof.  Locate the code that handles received proofs (this is in a webhook callback):

```
        if state == "presentation_received":
            # TODO handle received presentations
            pass
```

Add the following code under the ```# TODO``` comment (replace ```pass```):

```
            # TODO handle received presentations
            # if presentation is a degree schema (proof of education), check the received values
            is_proof_of_education = (message['presentation_request']['name'] == 'Proof of Education')
            if is_proof_of_education:
                log_status("#28.1 Received proof of education, check claims")
                for attr, value in message['presentation_request']['requested_attributes'].items():
                    # just print out the received claim values
                    self.log(value['name'], message['presentation']['requested_proof']['revealed_attrs'][attr]['raw'])
                for identifier in message['presentation']['identifiers']:
                    # just print out the schema/cred def id's of presented claims
                    self.log(identifier['schema_id'], identifier['cred_def_id'])
                # TODO placeholder for the next step
            else:
                # in case there are any other kinds of proofs received
                self.log("#28.1 Received ", message['presentation_request']['name'])
```

Right now this just prints out information received in the proof, but in "real life" your application could do somethign useful with this information.

Now you can run the Faber/Alice/Acme script from the "preview" section above, and you should see Acme receive a proof from Alice!


## Issuing Alice a Work Credential

Now we can issue a work credential to Alice!

There are two options for this.  We can (a) add code under option ```1``` to issue the credential, or (b) we can automatically issue this credential on receipt of the education proof.

We're going to do option (a), but you can try to implement option (b) as homework.  You have most of the information you need from the proof response!

First though we need to register a schema and credential definition.  Find this code:

```
            # TODO define schema
            #(schema_id, credential_definition_id) = await agent.register_schema_and_creddef(
            #    "employee id schema", version, ["employee_id", "name", "date", "position"]
            #    )
```

... and just uncommment it.  Easy, no?

```
            # TODO define schema
            (schema_id, credential_definition_id) = await agent.register_schema_and_creddef(
                "employee id schema", version, ["employee_id", "name", "date", "position"]
                )
```

For option (a) we want to replace the ```# TODO``` comment here:

```
            elif option == "1":
                log_status("#13 Issue credential offer to X")
                # TODO credential offers
```

Add the following code:

```
                # TODO credential offers
                log_status("#13 Issue credential offer to X")
                offer = {
                    "credential_definition_id": credential_definition_id,
                    "connection_id": agent.connection_id,
                }
                agent.cred_attrs[credential_definition_id] = {
                    "employee_id": "ACME0009",
                    "name": "Alice Smith",
                    "date": "2019-06-30",
                    "position": "CEO",
                }
                await agent.admin_POST("/credential_exchange/send-offer", offer)
```

... and then locate the code that handles the credential request callback:

```
        if state == "request_received":
            # TODO issue credentials based on the credential_definition_id
            pass
```

... and add the following code:

```
            # TODO issue credentials based on the credential_definition_id
            cred_attrs = self.cred_attrs[message["credential_definition_id"]]
            await self.admin_POST(
                f"/credential_exchange/{credential_exchange_id}/issue",
                {"credential_values": cred_attrs},
            )
```

Now you can run the Faber/Alice/Acme script again.  You should be able to receive a proof and then issue a credential to Alice.
